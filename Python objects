#few things to keep in mind.
#int= 1,2,3,4,6,324353546
#float= 1.2,4.6,123.54
#Python follow #PEMDAS: paranthesis exponent multiplication division addition subtraction
2*(3-6)/6

#VARIABLES#
few things to keep in mind
#no spaces
#no number at first
#no built in func
#no spec character

#dynamically types: means we can use a single named variable multiple times which is good. 
ex:  

b = 3
a = 5
c= a + b
c

d = 'this'
e = ' then'
f= d + e

g = str(a) + e

dynamic
b = b+ b
 now we have type function as well
 
 type(a)
<class 'int'>

type(f)
<class 'str'>
